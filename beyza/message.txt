hey whatsup if you still dealing with so many stuff, just remember you are overwhelmed right now also :D berfin just left and you didn't get the chance to work with her but somehow you felt bad about her leaving the bootcamp. you have very special friends now and please always remember their value and show them. being kind is more important. always remember this: ENJOY YOUR RÄ°DE and do the best you can. you always tell yourself these at this time. i wish to write more but i don't know what to say. so keep the hard work and always always always try to enjoy everything.
